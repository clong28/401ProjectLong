# Big Data, Bigger Upsets: Letting AI Embrace the Madness
This README file will contain all information needed to replicate my study and model on a High Computing Cluster.

This project uses machine learning (TensorFlow) to predict NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament outcomes based on historical team data. 
The goal is to build a model that can make realistic bracket predictions and benchmark its performance on different hardware configurations.
